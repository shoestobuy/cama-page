            The CAMA Corporation came to life when a little boy came up with a big idea, this idea caused a spark in his mind which made a flame and that which made a wildfire, that passion stills runs through CAMA and we only accept the most enthusiastic and best of game developers.Sadly the boy died and his life was grieved by many, the job was taken over by Boy.2 who through him CAMA continues thriving and succeding at everyhting it does.</div></center>

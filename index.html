            <P>CAMA is a game development company that makes and test games from 2019. Our Companies first ever game was released on the 15th of June 2019 named Flappy Falcon, making a turnover profit of $0, CAMA  was off for a good start. See here in CAMA we don't base our importance on money, rather we base our importance in seeking what is good, right and fair. As a famous quote goes from <a href="assets/images/boy1.jpg">Boy.2</a>(head,chief,CEO and leader and Chairman of the CAMA Corporation)."CAMA makes unique products, designed to capture the mind,heart and the soul." </P> </div></center>

            <P>The CAMA Corporation came to life when a little boy came up with a big idea, this idea caused a spark in his mind which made a flame and that which made a wildfire, that passion stills run through CAMA and we only accept the most enthusiastic and best of game developers. Sadly the boy died and his life was grieved by many, the job was taken over by <a href="assets/images/boy1.jpg">Boy.2</a> who through him CAMA continues thriving and succeding at everyhting it does.</P></div></center>

                <P><a href="assets/images/boy2.jpg">Boy.1</a> and <a href="assets/images/boy1.jpg">Boy.2</a> are both classified information.No one knows where they operate from and the rumour goes they operate from another dimension. Boy.2 frequently sends in files into CAMA HQ and that is the only communication from them. </P></div></center>

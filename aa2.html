        CAMA's inspiration according to the Boy(no one knew his real name)was the the Camel and the Lama,He liked thier trademark arrogant behaviour and thier uniqueness compared to all the other animals.He loved the way that they both look weak at first but when they need to they can unleash deadly bites, kicks and the occasional spit.Boy couldn't choose from both so he named the Corporation CAMA, hybrid between is "I love Lamas and Camels."

        <h3>The cHolo</h3>
        
        One of our new ideas that we are working on and going to release in the future is the cHolo.This portable gadget helps you to play a game outisde your house or dwelling place.What makes this unique that its competitors.Nintendo and PsVita is that this emmits a holographic image to play on, not on your normal touchscreen.

        <P class= "gold"> CAMA's inspiration according to the Boy(no one knew his real name)was the Camel and the Llama, He liked their trademark arrogant behaviour and their uniqueness compared to all the other animals. He loved the way that they both look weak at first but when they need to they can unleash deadly bites, kicks and the occasional spit. The boy couldn't choose from both so he named the Corporation CAMA, hybrid between is "I love Lamas and Camels."</P>

    <center><div id="fade"><h1 class="gold">Future ideas</h1>
        
        <P class= "gold">One of CAMA'S key values to success is proactiveness, this keeps us well on our feet and ready for and to start the new day. We are excited every second for our new and upcoming innovations and plans</P></div></center>
        
        
       <center><div> <h3 class="gold">The cHolo</h3>
        
           <P>One of our new ideas that we are working on and going to release in the future is the cHolo.This portable gadget helps you to play a game outside your house or dwelling place. What makes this unique that its competitors. Nintendo and PsVita are that this emits a holographic image to play on, not on your normal touchscreen.</P></div></center>
